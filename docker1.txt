Working on docker containers
================================
8 To start a stopped container
  docker start container_id/container_name

9 To stop a running container
  docker stop container_id/container_name

10 To restart a running container
   docker restart container_id/container_name
   To restart after 10 seconds
   docker restart -t 10 container_id/container_name

11 To remove or delete a stopped container
   docker rm container_id/container_name

12 To remove a running/stopped container
   docker rm -f container_id/container_name

13 To stop all running containers
   docker stop $(docker ps -aq)

14 To remove all stopped container

   Run command options
   ---------------------
   --name    Used to give a name for the container
   -it       Used to open interactive terminal in the container
   -v        Used for attaching a volume to a container

             Eg -p 8080:80   here 8080 is host machine port and 80 is container              port.Host machine port is called external port and container port is
             called internal port
   -P        Used for automatic port mapping ie the internal port of the container 
             will be mapped with an external port of docker host which is greater
             then 30000
   -d        Used to run the container in detached mode as a deamon
