Maven is a build tool of Java.
Maven is created by apache and it run on Apache community servers.
All the open source communities like Mysql,Junit etc upload their
updates API's into this maven global server.
We connect to the maven global server,download those API's that are 
necessary for our project and store them on a seperate server called
maven local repository.
All the developers connect theri projects to the maven local repository
and perfrom the coding
In this way the development code is stored sperately on Git and the
artifacts necessary for coding in maven local server.

This will help in protecting the code present in Git from an viruses that
might be present in the open source API's

Maven also works like a build tool where we can convert the 
.java programs into .class files and then into an artifact in the 
form of jar or war or ear files
