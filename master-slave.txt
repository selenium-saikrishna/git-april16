Setup of Master-Slave
==========================
1 Create a new AWS ubuntu18 instance

2 Install the same version of jave that we installed on master

3 Establish passwordless ssh between master and salve
  a) Connect to the slave machine with gitbash
  b) sudo passwd ubuntu
     Set an new password
  c) sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     Search for "PasswordAuthentication" and change it from no to yes
     Save and quit     Esc :wq Enter
  d) Restart ssh
     sudo service ssh restart
  e) Connect to master machine using gitbash
  f) Generate the ssh keys
     ssh-keygen
     The above command will create 2 keys called public key and private key
     in the .ssh folder
  g) ssh-copy-id ubuntu@ipaddress_of_slave
     The above command will copy the content of the public keys into a file 
     called authorised_keys on the slave machine.Once these keys are copied 
     master machine can ssh to the slave machine without password.The public        keys on slave will ask a security question which will be answered by the
     private keys on master.Once this question and answer match passwordless
     ssh will happen.
