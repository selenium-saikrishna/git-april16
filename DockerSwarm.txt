1 For the manager to remove a worker from the swarm(Drain)
  docker node update --availability drian Worker1

2 For the manager to make the worker rejoin the swarm(Active)
  docker node update --availibility active Worker1

3 For a worker to leave the swarm
  Go to the worker machine
  docker swarm leave

4 For the manager to leave the swarm
  Go to manager
  docker swarm leave --force


5 To generate the tokenid for a node to join as a worker
  docker swarm join-token worker

6 To generate the tokenid for a node to join as a manager
  docker swarm join-token manager

7 To promote Worker1 and make him as a manager
  docker node promote Worker1

8 To demote Worker1 again from manager to worker status
  docker node demote Worker1


1 Start tomcat with 5 replicas 
  docker service create --name tomcat --replcias 5 -p 8899:8080 tomcat

2 Check the nodes on which these 5 replcias are running
  docker service ps tomcat

3 Delete a tomcat container on manager
  docker container ls
  Capture the id of one tomcat container
  docker rm -f containerid

4 Check if all 5 replicas are still running
  docker service ps tomcat

5 Drain Worker1 from the swam
  docker node update --availability drain Worker1

6 Check if all 5 replicas are still running on manager and Worker2
  docker service ps tomcat





=============================================================
1 Create 2 overlay networks
  docker network create --driver overlay intelliq1
  docker network create --driver overlay intelliq2

2 To see list of networks
  docker network ls

3 Start nignx with 3 replcias on intelliq1 network
  docker service create --name mynginx --replicas 3 -p 9988:80 
                                            --network intelliq1 nginx

4 To check if mynginx is running on intelliq1 network
  docker service inspect mynginx --pretty

5 Start tomcat with 5 replicas on the default overlaynetwork
  docker service create --name tomcat --replicas 5 -p 8787:8080 tomcat

6 Update the network on tomcat to intelliq2
  docker service update --network-add intelliq2 tomcat

7 Check if tomcat service is running on intelliq2 
  docker service inspect tomcat --pretty
